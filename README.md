# My way of running Markdown #

(see [raw version](https://raw.github.com/ihrke/mi-markdown/master/README.md))

* github-style fenced code with syntax highlighting:

    \`\`\`python
    def func(a):
       print a
    \`\`\`
   
becomes

```python
def func(a):
   print a
```

* I will unscrupulously add whatever feature I like.

## Notes ##

Uses:

* [Python Markdown](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/)
* [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)
